# No Fast Fingers (just fast scripts)
Showcase of Puppeteer Automation used to crush in 10fastfingers.com by NicolÃ¡s Alurralde

## Requirements
- **Node** v8.12.0 or greater

## F.A.Q.

### Why the slowdown?
The challenge has a limited amount of words (around 344), and typing them too fast takes 15 seconds, with 45 seconds left, this would cause an afk popup.

## What's the highest WPM?
Never seen above 361 WPM

## Is this cheating?
It's not the intention to get highscores nor compete, the purpose of this proyect is to showcase the usage of Puppeteer in automated scripts.
